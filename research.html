												<h2>Impact of Red Supergiant Winds in Formation of Compact Object Binaries</h2>

											<p>In 2020, Emma Beasor and collaborators provided a novel mass loss prescription for Red Supergiant (RSG) stars
												in terms of their initial masses, in addition to their luminosities.
												<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.07222.pdf" target="_blank">Their paper</a> reported lower rates for these stars than previously thought,
												implying significant consequences for their evolutionary history and compact object fate. However, things get complicated if binary interactions
												are brought into the mix. Binary stars can gain or lose mass and can change evolutionary tracks on the HR diagram, taking on paths not expected of
												their single star counterparts. HR Diagram evolutionary paths are very much dictated by initial mass. So what happens when a lower mass loss rate that
												depends on initial mass, is introduced to the system? What does that mean for the compact objects these stars would form? Does that impact mergers and would
												it be of importance for something like LIGO - a detector well suited for measuring gravitational waves for compact object mergers? I'm using
												<a href="https://cosmic-popsynth.github.io/" target="_blank">COSMIC</a>,a binary population synthesis code, to investigate this by
												modifying the mass loss prescription for Red Supergiant stars. Stay tuned for a paper! </p>

												<h2>Implementing MRI in the Interior of Solar Type Stars</h2>
												<h3>Supervisor : <a href="http://individual.utoronto.ca/kmenou/Homepage.html" target="_blank"><u>Kristen Menou</u></a></h3>
											</header>
											<p> With recent advances in the field of observational asteroseismology, we are getting pretty good at measuring
												the internal rotation of stars. But our models are yet to catch up. The solar core, for instance, is rotating
												slower than what models can reproduce. This implies that the angular momentum transport inside the Sun is more
												efficient than what our current models imply. The nonlinear nature of the problem itself makes a complete 3D model
												of the problem computationally expensive, and therefore near impossible. However, reducing dimensionality means compromising
												on facets of the problem that could be crucial to understanding internal rotation within stars. Given that, the best we can do
												is come up with prescriptions that can closely reproduce observations, despite being approximations of the ongoing physics.
											</br>
												In their <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0606358.pdf" target="_blank">2006 paper</a>, Menou and Le Mer proposed a dispersion relation
												approach to implementing Magneto-rotational Instability or MRI - a double diffusive instability that is very well modelled in astrophysical disks
												- for the interior of the early Sun. I'm trying to translate their MRI recipe to <a href="https://docs.mesastar.org/en/release-r22.05.1/">MESA </a>
												- a one-dimensional stellar evolution code.
												Magnetic fields transport angular momentum on scales larger than simply hydrodynamic instabilities and Menou and Le Mer 2006 found that
												MRI modes may have existed in a young sun. I'm working on extending their work and hope to explore a parameter space on the HR Diagram
												to chart the effects of MRI on core rotation rates.
